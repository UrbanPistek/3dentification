## Idea

To make a small breakoutboard with ADC, Amplifier, LED contorl and a color sensor, that is easy to interface via a Qwiic/StemmaQT I2C connector. 

## Changes from the original plastic scanner
The board has the following changes from the original:
- The ADC ADS1256 we interfaced SPI is changed to the NAU7802 ADC that we interface via I2C
- AS7341 I2C color sensor added
- 5v changed to 3.3v to comply with Qwiic/stemmaQT guidelines


## Notes
- Holes are M2 holes (iso 7380)
